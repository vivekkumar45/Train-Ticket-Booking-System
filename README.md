# Train-Ticket-Booking-System

The Train Ticket Booking System is a web-based application designed to simplify and streamline the process of searching, booking, and managing train tickets. Built using Laravel, PHP, Bootstrap, and other modern web technologies, this project provides users with an intuitive interface to explore available train options, make reservations, and manage their bookings.

The system offers the following features:

Search Trains: Users can search for trains by entering their departure and destination cities, travel date, and preferred class (e.g., Economy, Business, First Class).
Booking Management: Users can view their booking details, including departure, destination, train name, seat number, travel date, and class.
Dynamic Data: The system dynamically fetches and displays train and booking information from the backend, ensuring real-time updates.
User-Friendly Interface: Responsive design and Bootstrap integration provide a seamless experience across devices.
Error Handling: Informative messages for empty search results or no bookings, enhancing user experience.
This project demonstrates key skills in web application development, including backend logic with Laravel and php, dynamic views using Blade templating, and a clean, responsive frontend design using Bootstrap.
